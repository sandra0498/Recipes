Quick Chinese Scallion Pancakes|The Worktop|You can have these quick and easy Chinese Scallion Pancakes cooking on the stove top within five minutes. Inspired by the method to make Western-style pancakes, I've adapted it to make Chinese savory pancakes. The only tools required for these quick scallion pancakes is just one bowl and one skillet.|5|20|2 cups all-purpose flour@1 2/3 cups water@1/4 cup pure sesame oil@3/4 teaspoon salt@2 bunches scallions@oil|In a large bowl, mix together the flour, water, sesame oil and salt using a whisk until smooth. Set aside.@In the meantime, wash and finely chop the scallions, discarding the roots and the tips of the green tops. Using your fingers, quickly break apart the chopped scallions to separate out the layers. Mix into the batter. @Heat about 2 teaspoons of oil in large frying pan (I use one that is 10-inch / 25-cm) on medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, swirl the oil around so it coats the pan. @Quickly ladle on the batter in the shape of a ring, then immediately use a spatula to spread the batter to fill the ring, and to spread the batter outward to make the pancake into a circle (I use about 3/4 cup of batter for each pancake on a 10-inch pan). The batter will cook quickly on the hot pan, so just spread it around as much as you can. @Cook the pancake for about 4 minutes, periodically lifting the pancake up to check if the bottom has browned. When the scallion pancake has browned on the bottom, lift the pancake up with a spatula, quickly add a bit more oil to the pan, and flip the pancake. @Cook for another 4-5 minutes until the bottom is browned. Remove from heat and set on a oil absorbing paper (or paper towel) to remove the excess oil. Repeat with the remaining batter. Using 2 frying pans simultaneously will speed up the cooking process. @Serve immediately.

Vegan Banana Pancakes|The Work Top|This recipe for Vegan Banana Pancakes is a real go-to recipe for ripe bananas. This delicious and easy banana pancake recipe is made without sugar, eggless, and dairy free. If you have ever wanted to know how to make banana pancakes, this recipe will give you step by step instructions. |5|15|2 medium ripe bananas@1 tablespoon coconut oil (you can use any neutral oil) - melted@3/4 cup spelt flour (I use wholegrain spelt)@1/2 cup quick cook oats@1 teaspoon vanilla extract@1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon@1/2 teaspoon baking powder@1 cup oat milk (any non-dairy milk alternative would work)@coconut oil or oil - for cooking pancakes|In a medium bowl, mash the bananas well. Whisk in the coconut oil. Add all the dry ingredients and roughly mix together. Whisk in the oat milk until the batter is well mixed.@Lightly coat a large non-stick skillet or griddle with a bit of coconut oil or oil, then heat over medium to medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, working in batches, spoon about 3 tablespoons of pancake batter onto the pan for each pancake. I usually use an ice cream scoop with a release trigger so all the pancakes are evenly sized. If needed, gently and lightly use the back of the spoon to guide the pancake batter so it spreads out into a 4-inch diameter round. Make sure to leave room between pancakes so you can easily flip the pancakes.@Cook on one side, until there are some bubbles on the top, and the bottom is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip the pancakes, and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 more minutes.@Transfer to plates, top with desired toppings, and serve.
